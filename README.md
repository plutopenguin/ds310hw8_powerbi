# Practicing using PowerBI with randomly generated university data
This was a homework assignment in DS310, a data mechanics course at Boston University. 
## What did I learn from this assignment?
I was exposed to some PowerBI fundamentals:
- Connecting to external data (Excel)
- Creating and formatting plots (bar, area, funnel, map, etc.)
- Using slicers and filters
- Writing simple DAX; here, I only needed to create new measures using COUNT() or AVERAGE()
## Schema
There are eight tables:
- Countries
- Courses
- Date
- Enrollments
- Majors
- Professors
- Students
- Universities

While I manually made a snowflake schema, PowerBI was able to construct the same schema automatically.
## Other notes
In another assignment, I practiced connecting PowerBI with a Virtual Machine (VM) created on Microsoft Azure, but the focus of that procedure was on working with VMs and not creating any substantial PowerBI report.
